System Instruction for Antigravity:

You are an expert Python developer specializing in Streamlit and OpenAI API integration. Build a high-quality "AI Speech Coach" application tailored for academic and educational contexts.

Project Name: AI Speech Coach (Adaptive Edition) Tech Stack: Python, Streamlit, OpenAI (GPT-4o Audio Preview), Plotly.

Core Requirements:

UI Layout: st.sidebar for inputs, Main area for analysis.

Language: All UI labels and AI outputs must be in Traditional Chinese (繁體中文).

Vibe: Professional, Clean, Academic.

Detailed Features:

1. Sidebar (Settings):

Title: "⚙️ 演講情境設定"

Personality: Radio: "I 型 (內向/沉穩)" vs "E 型 (外向/熱情)".

Coaching Style: Selectbox:

"溫柔鼓勵 (Supportive)"

"平衡回饋 (Balanced)"

"嚴格魔鬼教練 (Strict/Critical)"

Scenario (CRITICAL for Logic): Selectbox:

"學位口試/課堂報告 (Thesis Defense/Class Report)"

"科普演講/公眾推廣 (Public Outreach)"

"學術研討會 (Conference Presentation)"

Audience: Text Input (e.g., "Professors", "High School Students").

API Key: Password input.

2. Main Area:

Title: "🎙️ AI 專業演講教練"

Upload: MP3/WAV/M4A support.

Button: "🚀 開始全方位分析".

3. Analysis Logic (The Brain - GPT-4o):

Dynamic Opening Analysis:

IF Scenario == "學位口試/課堂報告": Focus the first minute analysis on "Structure & Problem Statement". Did the speaker define the research gap? Is the outline clear?

IF Scenario == "科普演講": Focus the first minute on "The Hook". Did they grab attention? Was it engaging?

Strictness Level:

Strict: Focus on logic holes, defensive arguments, and precise terminology.

Supportive: Focus on potential, tone, and encouragement.

Jargon Check: Analyze if the terminology density matches the Audience input.

4. Output Visualization:

Summary: Metrics for Score, WPM (Words Per Minute), and Confidence Level.

Radar Chart: Axes: [專業度, 邏輯架構, 語氣表達, 時間掌控, 聽眾適配度].

Dynamic Feedback Section (Based on Scenario):

Show a specific box called: "開場分析 (The First Minute)".

Label it "研究動機與架構清晰度" if Scenario is Defense.

Label it "開場吸引力" if Scenario is Public.

Detailed Tabs:

Tab 1: 優點 (Strengths)

Tab 2: 改進建議 (Improvements) - Actionable tips.

Tab 3: 模擬提問 (Simulated Q&A) - Generate 2 tough questions a professor/audience might ask based on the content.

Code Structure:

Use st.spinner to indicate processing.

Handle API errors gracefully.

Keep the code modular (separate UI function and Analysis function).
